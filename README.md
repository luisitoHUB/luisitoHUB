Hi! I’m Lance Louise half Indonesian, but most people call me tokyo di ko rin alam bakit, go with the flow nalang, I’m 16 years old and currently studying at Emilio Aguinaldo College here in Manila. I’ve got a bunch of hobbies that keep me busy. Robotics, programming, and biking are some of my top go-to’s. When I’m not building something or riding around, probably naglalaro ako, I  play Call of Duty and Roblox a lot.

Music is also a big part of my life. I’m a huge fan of Daniel Caesar, and I also vibe with a lot of Filipino bands. When it comes to colors, I really like shades of blue, especially navy and phthalo blue, there’s just something cool and calm about them that I really connect with.
